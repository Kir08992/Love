   <p style="color: yellow">In this year's velvet night, my heart a trembling star,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">I counted constellations, each a distant, hopeful scar.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Then, a light, a lunar glow, eclipsed the fading dawn,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">And in that moonlit grace, my loneliness was gone.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">  </p>
   <p style="color: yellow">A silver symphony, your presence filled the air,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Each whisper of your laughter, a balm for my despair.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">You are the moon, a beacon in the darkest, coldest night,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">And I, a yearning satellite, forever drawn to your light.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">  </p>
   <p style="color: yellow">I long to be a star, a jewel in your celestial crown,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">To dance with you in starlight, where shadows never drown.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Without you, my heart is a shooting star, lost in the void,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Yearning for the solace that your presence has deployed.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">  </p>
   <p style="color: yellow">You are my compass, guiding me through life's uncertain maze,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Leading me to a haven where my soul finds its amaze.</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">A perfect haven, bathed in your lunar, gentle light,</p>
   <p style="color: yellow">Where I find solace, hope, and love, forever shining bright.</p>
